# Delivery Center Location Optimization for We-Doo

This repository contains the code and analysis for optimizing the location of a delivery center for the 'We-Doo' last-mile delivery service using simulation and statistical analysis. Includes methodologies such as ANOVA, F-statistics, and route optimization to minimize operational costs and enhance delivery efficiency. The project aims to identify the most cost-effective warehouse location by simulating day-to-day operations, optimizing delivery routes, and evaluating various operational factors such as parcel volumes, driver working times, and overall operational costs.

## Key Features
- **Simulation of Delivery Operations**: Includes synthetic workload data and simulation of daily delivery operations.
- **Route Optimization**: Utilizes algorithms to find the shortest delivery routes and minimizes travel distance.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Applies ANOVA and F-statistics to determine the significance of cost differences across various warehouse locations.
- **Cost Evaluation**: Calculates and compares total operational costs for different candidate locations to find the optimal site.

## Results
The analysis determined that the optimal warehouse location is at coordinates (1760, 4000), which offers the lowest total cost among the evaluated options.

## Future Work
The project lays the foundation for more advanced simulations and optimizations, potentially incorporating additional variables or refining the current models.
